# SpotleAIthon
Attempting to build a mood detector app using python for the second level of AIthon on spotle.ai

The mood detector app was built based on the given training data using Python and with the help of its libraries like Keras, Numpy and Pandas. Deep learning concepts like convolutional neural networks were implemented with the help of Keras to build an appropriate model. The app classifies mood or emotions based on facial expressions( the input data being an image reduced to gray scale with 48x48 pixels) into three categories happy, sad and fear.
